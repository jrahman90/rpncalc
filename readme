RPM Calc:
===================
RPM Calc is a CLI tool for Reverse Polish Notation Calculations. 
In a reverse polish notation calculator, first comes the integers,
then the operators. example:

traditional calculator :    5 - 2
                            3
RPN calculator:             5 2 -
                            3
===================



===================
* Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural
readline API - 
===================
In this release you have the options of running standard arithmetic 
operators like addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/)

In future releases we plan on implementing additional operators.

===================
How to run RPM Calc:
1. Make sure you have node running on your maching (you can check by running the command node on your terminal or command line)
2. cd into the rpn-calc folder
3. run $ node ./rpncalc
4. enter mathematical problems and press enter for the solution
** operators following the integers with a single space seperation
