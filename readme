RPM Calc:
===================
RPM Calc is a CLI tool for Reverse Polish Notation Calculations. 
In a reverse polish notation calculator, first comes the integers,
then the operators. example:

traditional calculator :    5 - 2
                            3
RPN calculator:             5 2 -
                            3
===================

This app takes in a reverse polish notation expression and returns the mathematical solution.
in the command line you insert the expression, the algo will then take that expression and 
loop through it. it takes the integers and puts them in a stack and once it detects an operator
it takes the top 2 integers from the stack and calculates using the operator. then it places that 
solution back on top of the stack. if there are more operators left in the stack it will keep
running the algorithm until only one integer is left in the stack. at this point it will log
that single integer in the stack which is our solution.  

===================
readline API - i used readline to get an input from the terminal. 
JavaScript was used to write the algorithm. 

===================
In this release you have the options of running standard arithmetic 
operators like addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/)

In future releases we plan on implementing additional operators.

===================
How to run RPM Calc:
1. Make sure you have node running on your maching (you can check by running the command node on your terminal or command line)
2. cd into the rpn-calc folder
3. run $ node ./rpncalc
4. enter mathematical problems and press enter for the solution
** operators following the integers with a single space seperation

> -13 13 +
